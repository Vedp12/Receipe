# Django Recipe CRUD Application

This is my first project in Django that includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project is a simple recipe management system where users can add, view, update, and delete recipes. The project uses Django as the web framework and SQLite as the database.

## Project Introduction

The project is designed to manage recipes with the following features:
- **Create**: Users can add new recipes with details such as name, description, ingredients, and an image.
- **Read**: Users can view a list of all recipes along with their details.
- **Update**: Users can update the details of an existing recipe.
- **Delete**: Users can delete a recipe from the list.

The project is structured into two main Django apps: `Home` and `Menu`. The `Home` app contains the main configuration and settings, while the `Menu` app contains the models, views, and templates for managing recipes.



## How I Completed the Project

The project took approximately two weeks to complete. Here is a brief overview of the steps I followed:

1. **Project Setup**: I started by setting up the Django project and creating the necessary apps (`Home` and `Menu`).
2. **Database Design**: I designed the database schema for the `Receipe` model, which includes fields for name, description, ingredients, and image.
3. **Views and Templates**: I created views for handling CRUD operations and corresponding templates for the user interface.
4. **Static Files**: I added static files such as CSS for styling the templates.
5. **Testing**: I tested the application to ensure all CRUD operations work as expected.
6. **Deployment**: I configured the project for deployment, including setting up the WSGI and ASGI configurations.

## Design and Libraries

The project is designed with a simple and clean user interface using Bootstrap for styling. The main libraries and tools used in the project are:

- **Django**: The web framework used for building the application.
- **SQLite**: The database used for storing recipe data.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework used for styling the templates.
- **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library used for handling image uploads.

## Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience for me as it was my first project in Django. It helped me understand the basics of Django, including models, views, templates, and static files. I also learned how to handle file uploads and perform CRUD operations in Django.

I hope this project serves as a good starting point for anyone looking to learn Django and build their own web applications.
